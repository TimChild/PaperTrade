# Project Backlog

Minor improvements, tech debt, and enhancements that don't block main development.

**Last Updated**: March 7, 2026

## Active Backlog

### 🔄 In Progress (Agent Tasks)

1. **Backend Quality Fixes** — Task 192, PR #192 (backend-swe agent)

   - Add MkDocs configuration and deploy docs site on Proxmox
   - Establish clear conventions that all agents follow
   - **Status**: Draft task written, not started

2. **Phase 4: Automated Trading Strategies** — Planning needed

### 🔄 High Priority (Previously)

1. **Fix Weekend Cache Validation Tests** — ⬆️ Moved to Task 192
   - **Status**: In progress (backend-swe agent)

2. **Investigate Slow App Performance with ~50 Portfolios** — ⬆️ Moved to Task 192
   - **Status**: In progress (backend-swe agent)
     - Review frontend rendering performance with large lists
   - **Effort**: ~2-4 hours for investigation

### 🎯 UX Improvements - HIGH PRIORITY (Quick Wins!)

These are polished, user-facing features that would significantly improve the experience:

1. ~~**Show Purchase Points on Stock Price Charts**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE** (PR #161, #166)
   - **Status**: Implemented with scatter plot markers (green BUY, red SELL)
   - **Fixed**: Tooltip type safety issue and Y-axis domain calculation (PR #166)
   - **Quality**: 122 new tests added, comprehensive edge case coverage

2. **Interactive Click-to-Trade from Charts** - ~2-3 hours
   - **Problem**: Manual entry of ticker and date when looking at charts
   - **Solution**: Click on any stock chart to auto-fill trade form
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add onClick handler to price chart points
     - Extract clicked date and ticker
     - Scroll to trade form and populate ticker + date fields
     - Optional: Populate price from chart data
   - **UX Flow**: Click chart → Trade form appears with pre-filled data → Just enter quantity
   - **Benefit**: Reduces friction for "what-if" trades and backtesting

2. **Show Real-Time Stock Prices in Holdings** - ~1-2 hours
   - **Problem**: Holdings table shows "Using average cost (current price unavailable)" with asterisk
   - **Impact**: Users can't see if their stocks went up or down
   - **Solution**: Fetch current prices from Alpha Vantage for each holding, display in "Current Price" column
   - **Implementation**:
     - ✅ Batch price endpoint already exists: `GET /api/v1/prices/batch?tickers=AAPL,MSFT`
     - Update frontend holdings query to call batch endpoint
     - Display current prices in Holdings table
     - Show P&L indicators (green/red) for gains/losses
   - **Note**: Depends on weekend price fix being complete (PR #158 merged)
   - **Found**: Manual UI testing (2026-01-07)

3. ~~**Add Toast Notifications for Trade Actions**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE** (PR #163)
   - **Status**: Centralized toast utility with react-hot-toast
   - **Features**: Trade success/error, deposit/withdraw, portfolio management
   - **Quality**: 18 tests, E2E compatibility verified

4. ~~**Highlight New Transactions**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE** (PR #164)
   - **Status**: 3-second pulse animation on new transaction rows
   - **Implementation**: TanStack Query cache manipulation with isNew flag
   - **Quality**: 12 tests, accessibility features (aria-live)

---

### 📊 Analytics Enhancements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

These improve the analytics/insights capabilities:

1. **Stacked Area Chart - Portfolio Composition Over Time** - ~4-6 hours
   - **Problem**: Current analytics show total value over time (line chart) and current composition (pie chart), but not composition over time
   - **Current State**:
     - ✅ Backend: Daily snapshots already capture `total_value`, `cash_balance`, `holdings_value` per day
     - ✅ Backend: `PerformanceChart` shows total portfolio value over time
     - ✅ Backend: `CompositionChart` shows current asset allocation (pie chart)
   - **Goal**: Show how portfolio composition changed over time (similar to pie chart but stacked over time)
   - **Solution**: Create stacked area chart showing cash + individual stock holdings
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Backend**: Extend snapshot to include per-ticker breakdown
       - Add `holdings_breakdown: dict[str, Decimal]` to `PortfolioSnapshot`
       - Calculate value of each ticker at snapshot time
       - Store in `portfolio_snapshots` table as JSON column
     - **Backend**: Update `/portfolios/{id}/performance` endpoint to include breakdown
     - **Frontend**: New `PortfolioCompositionOverTime` component using Recharts `AreaChart`
       - Each ticker gets its own area (different color)
       - Cash at bottom, stocks stacked on top
       - Total height = portfolio value
   - **Benefit**: See how diversification changed, when you added/removed positions
   - **Note**: This is a bigger change requiring schema migration

2. **Calculate Portfolio Value Over Time in Backend** - ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
   - **Current State**:
     - ✅ Backend has `PortfolioSnapshot` entity (daily snapshots)
     - ✅ Daily job runs at midnight UTC (`calculate_daily_snapshots`)
     - ✅ Snapshots stored in PostgreSQL
     - ✅ `/portfolios/{id}/performance` API endpoint returns time series data
     - ✅ Frontend `PerformanceChart` displays the data
   - **What was for backtesting**: The `as_of` parameter on trade execution
   - **Status**: Working as designed! No action needed.

### Testing & Quality (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **E2E Tests in Agent Environment** - ✅ **COMPLETE** (PR #147, #154)
   - **Status**: E2E tests working in CI with Clerk authentication
   - **Solution**: Shared auth state via Playwright setup project, reduced API calls from 14 to 1-2
   - **Impact**: Reliable E2E tests both locally and in CI, no rate limiting issues
   - **Agent Environment**: Still uses unit tests only (browser install impractical), E2E validation in main CI

2. **Implement Skipped Scheduler Tests** - ~4-6 hours
   - 4 tests in `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_scheduler.py` are skipped
   - Reasons: "Requires database setup", "timing-dependent", "complex integration"
   - Solution: Proper mocking for market data, event-based assertions, split complex tests
   - See: Task #039 (to be created)

2. **Migrate E2E Tests to Test IDs** - ✅ **COMPLETE** (PR #55)
   - **Status**: `data-testid` attributes added throughout frontend
   - **Impact**: More reliable E2E tests, eliminated selector ambiguity
   - **Scope**: Portfolio creation, trade forms, transaction history

### Code Quality & Linting (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **React Patterns** - ✅ **COMPLETE** (PRs #134, #135)
   - **Status**: Codebase now has **0 ESLint suppressions** across all files!
   - **Achievement**: Removed last suppression from TradeForm.tsx (setState-in-useEffect → key prop pattern)
   - **Quality**: 234 frontend tests passing, exceptional code quality

2. **SQLAlchemy Deprecation** - ✅ **COMPLETE** (PR #49)
   - **Status**: Migrated from `session.execute()` to `session.exec()`
   - **Impact**: 0 deprecation warnings (was 129 warnings)

3. **Ruff Linting** - ✅ **COMPLETE**
   - **Status**: 0 ruff warnings in backend code
   - All checks passing in CI

### Code Improvements & Technical Debt (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **Admin Authentication TODOs** - ~2-4 hours
   - **Found**: 6 TODO comments in `analytics.py` endpoints
   - **Issue**: Analytics endpoints marked "Admin only" but no auth check implemented
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `/analytics/backtest` - Admin-only backtesting
     - `/analytics/recalculate/{portfolio_id}` - Manual snapshot recalculation
     - `/analytics/recalculate-all` - Batch recalculation
   - **Solution**: Add admin role check (requires extending Clerk integration or creating admin flag)
   - **Priority**: LOW (production app is single-user for now)
   - **Note**: Also add user ownership verification for portfolio-specific endpoints
**Issue**: Same 4-line pattern in 5 command handlers
   - **Solution**: Create utility function to reduce duplication
   - **Benefit**: DRY principle, easier maintenance

3. **Add Database Indexes** - ~1 hour
   - **Tables**: `Transaction.portfolio_id` and `Transaction.timestamp`
   - **Implementation**: Add to SQLModel models with proper migration
   - **Benefit**: Faster queries as transaction history grows

4. **Bundle Size Analysis** - ~30 minutes
   - **Command**: `npm run build && npx vite-bundle-visualizer`
   - **Goal**: Document findings, optimize if needed
   - **Priority**: Not urgent (app is fast), but good to baseline
