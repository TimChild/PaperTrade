# E2E QA Validation Task

**Task Type**: Reusable QA Template
**Agent**: qa
**Priority**: High (when executed)
**Estimated Effort**: 30-45 minutes

## Objective

Perform comprehensive end-to-end quality assurance testing of the Zebu application to validate critical user workflows, identify bugs, and ensure the application meets quality standards before release or after significant changes.

## Context

This is a reusable task template that can be referenced by the orchestrator whenever comprehensive QA validation is needed. The QA agent should execute all test scenarios systematically and produce a detailed test report.

**When to use this task**:
- After merging multiple PRs affecting core features
- Before deploying to production
- After major refactoring or architecture changes
- When user-reported issues suggest broader quality concerns
- Periodically (e.g., weekly) as part of quality maintenance

## Test Scenarios to Execute

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Setup

```bash
# Ensure services are running
cd /Users/timchild/github/Zebu

# Start Docker services
task docker:up

# Start backend in background
mkdir -p temp
cd backend && uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload > ../temp/backend.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > ../temp/backend.pid
cd ..

# Start frontend in background
cd frontend && npm run dev > ../temp/frontend.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > ../temp/frontend.pid
cd ..

# Wait for services
sleep 5

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -I http://localhost:5173/
```

### Execution

1. Use Playwright MCP tools for browser automation
2. Document each step with timestamps
3. Capture screenshots for:
   - Initial state
   - After each major action
   - Any errors or unexpected behavior
4. Save console logs after each scenario
5. Note network requests for failed operations

### Evidence Collection

For each scenario, capture:
- **Screenshots**: Before/after key actions
- **Console Logs**: `mcp_microsoft_pla_browser_console_messages()`
- **Network Traces**: `mcp_microsoft_pla_browser_network_requests()`
- **Page State**: `mcp_microsoft_pla_browser_snapshot()` when relevant

### Cleanup

```bash
# Stop services
kill $(cat temp/backend.pid) 2>/dev/null || true
kill $(cat temp/frontend.pid) 2>/dev/null || true

# Review logs if needed
# cat temp/backend.log
# cat temp/frontend.log
```

# Fix Trade Execution 503 Error

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Agent**: backend-swe
**Related QA Report**: agent_tasks/progress/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_e2e-qa-report.md

## Issue

Trading workflow fails with 503 Service Unavailable error, blocking all trade execution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to Trade page
2. Enter: Symbol=AAPL, Quantity=5, Order=Buy
3. Click Execute
4. Observe: 503 error modal

## Analysis

From QA testing: [summary from report]

Likely causes:
- Alpha Vantage rate limiting (5 calls/min free tier)
- Missing retry logic
- Cache not being checked before API call

## Expected Behavior

Trade should either:
- Execute successfully if price available
- Queue for retry if rate limited
- Use cached price if recent enough
- Show clear message if temporarily unavailable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Trade executes successfully with available price
- [ ] Rate limit errors handled gracefully
- [ ] User sees clear message during rate limit
- [ ] Cached prices used when available
- [ ] Retry logic implemented for transient failures
```

## Success Criteria

This QA task is complete when:
- ✅ All test scenarios executed
- ✅ Comprehensive test report created in `agent_tasks/progress/`
- ✅ All failures documented with evidence
- ✅ Follow-up tasks created for critical/high issues
- ✅ Severity assessment provided for all findings
- ✅ Actionable recommendations given
- ✅ Services cleaned up properly

## Notes

- **Test Data**: Use prefix "QA Test" in portfolio names for easy identification and cleanup
- **Timing**: Allow 30-45 minutes for comprehensive testing
- **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of Alpha Vantage limits - wait between tests if needed
- **Mock User**: Use existing mock user ID or create new test user if needed
- **Repeatability**: Document exact conditions so tests can be replicated
