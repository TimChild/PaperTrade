feat(proxmox): add automated deployment scripts and Taskfile tasks

- Add shell scripts for Proxmox LXC container management:
  - create-container.sh: Creates privileged LXC with Docker
  - deploy.sh: Full deployment pipeline with safety checks
  - status.sh: View deployment status and access URLs
  - logs.sh: Stream application logs

- Add Taskfile tasks:
  - proxmox:create-container: Create new LXC container
  - proxmox:deploy: Deploy/update application
  - proxmox:status: Show status
  - proxmox:logs: View logs
  - proxmox:update: Alias for deploy

- Scripts include safety features:
  - Check for existing containers before creating
  - Validate Proxmox connection
  - Error handling with clear messages
  - Auto-generate secure credentials

- Add comprehensive documentation in scripts/proxmox/README.md
- Update docs/deployment/proxmox-deployment.md with manual steps

This implements repeatable, automated Proxmox deployment workflow to avoid
manual SSH commands and provide safer container management.
