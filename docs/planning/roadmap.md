**Timeline**: After Phase 5 / 6, based on demand

---

## ❌ What We're NOT Building (For Now)

Some features are commonly requested but out of scope:

### Not Planned in 2026

- **Cryptocurrency Trading** - Different market (24/7), different rules
- **Options & Derivatives** - Too complex for MVP
- **Margin Trading / Leverage** - Adds significant risk simulation complexity
- **Short Selling** - Requires margin accounts and borrowing logic
- **Tax Reporting** - Complex regulations, country-specific
- **Mobile Native Apps** - Web app works on mobile; native apps maybe 2027+
- **Multi-Currency** - USD only for now

**Why Not?**
- These features distract from core value (learning to trade stocks)
- Complexity doesn't match user needs yet
- Can add later if demand grows

## 💬 How to Influence the Roadmap

We listen to users! Here's how to make your voice heard:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Request features or report bugs
2. **Discord/Slack**: Join community discussions (coming soon)
3. **Email**: feedback@zebu.com (coming soon)
4. **Surveys**: Quarterly user surveys (coming soon)

**Most Impactful**:
- Explain **why** you want a feature (your use case)
- Describe **how often** you'd use it
- Note **alternatives** you're currently using

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Principles

How we decide what to build:

1. **User Value First**: Will users care? Does it solve a real pain point?
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Small, shippable features over big-bang releases
3. **Quality > Speed**: Well-tested features that work reliably
4. **Learning Focus**: Features that help users learn investing
5. **Realistic Simulation**: Accurate market behavior over gamification

**Recent Example**:
- User need: "I can't sell stocks" (HIGH pain)
- Solution: Phase 3a (SELL orders)
- Prioritization: Moved ahead of analytics (less painful)
- Delivery: 2-3 weeks (small, focused effort)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

Current limitations and future plans:

### Low Priority (Future Improvements)
1. ⚠️ **No dark mode** → Future (user feedback will prioritize)
2. ⚠️ **Whole shares only** → Future (fractional shares complex)
3. ⚠️ **USD currency only** → Future (multi-currency)
4. ⚠️ **API rate limits (5/min, 500/day)** → Future (consider paid tier or multi-provider)
5. ⚠️ **No advanced order types** → Phase 4 (limit, stop orders)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I trade both buy and sell?**
A: Yes! Both BUY and SELL orders are fully functional with cost basis tracking.

**Q: Can I use this for real trading?**
A: No! Zebu is a **simulation** with virtual money. Use it to learn, then trade for real elsewhere.

**Q: Will there be a mobile app?**
A: Not in 2026. The web app works on mobile browsers. Phase 4a will improve mobile experience. Native apps maybe 2027+.

**Q: Can I import my real brokerage trades?**
A: Not yet. Planned for future (CSV import). For now, manually re-create trades.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! Clerk authentication ensures data privacy with industry-standard security. Your portfolios are private and protected.

**Q: How accurate are the prices?**
A: We use Alpha Vantage API (real market data). Free tier has 15-20 min delays. Paid tier is real-time.

**Q: Can I test my strategy from 2020?**
A: Yes! Backtesting is fully functional. You can create portfolios at past dates and execute historical trades using the `as_of` parameter.

**Q: Will this always be free?**
A: Core features will always be free. We may add premium features (real-time data, advanced analytics) for a small fee in 2027+.
