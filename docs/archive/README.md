## When to Archive

Documents should be moved to this directory when:
- They represent a historical snapshot of the project at a specific date
- They document completed work that is no longer actively referenced
- They are superseded by newer documentation
- They contain valuable context but are not part of active development

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- [../README.md](../README.md) - Documentation index
- [../../PROGRESS.md](../../PROGRESS.md) - Current development status
- [../../BACKLOG.md](../../BACKLOG.md) - Active planning and improvements
